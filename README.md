# Symfony bunq Bundle

A Symfony 3.4 LTS compatible Bundle for interaction with the European bunq bank. This is just a library bundle, this bundle is not a full executable project. It's designed to help myself and other people quickly start their new bunq-connected ideas.

This is obviously still a work in progress.  

## Goals
- Provide easy console commmand(s) to set up API connections with bunq
- Dispatch Symfony events on all bunq events
- Provide easy registration for callbacks
